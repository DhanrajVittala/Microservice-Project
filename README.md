The project is a microservices-based system developed using Java and Spring Boot, with data storage managed by MySQL and MongoDB. It utilizes Docker for containerization, allowing seamless deployment across various environments. For distributed tracing and monitoring, Zipkin and Sleuth are integrated into the architecture. Kafka is employed as a messaging system to facilitate event-driven communication between services. Additionally, Resilience4j is incorporated for handling faults and enhancing resilience within the system. This comprehensive stack ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient management of data flows in the microservices ecosystem.
